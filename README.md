This blogging application is a robust backend solution built using modern technologies and best practices. Below is a refined description of the application's core features:

**Framework & Technologies**: The application is developed using **Spring Boot** for the backend framework, ensuring scalability, reliability, and rapid development. It leverages Spring Security for securing endpoints and **JWT** (JSON Web Token) for user authentication and authorization.

**Role-Based Authentication**: The system supports role-based authentication, allowing for the management of user access levels and permissions across the platform.

**Data Management**: The application utilizes **Spring Data JPA** (Hibernate) for efficient data management and **ORM** (Object-Relational Mapping), ensuring seamless interaction with the MySQL database.

**DTO (Data Transfer Object)**: DTOs are used for secure and efficient data transfer between layers, decoupling the internal data model from the external API representation.

**API Documentation**: The application integrates **Swagger** for automatic API documentation, providing developers and stakeholders with clear and interactive API documentation for testing and integration.

**Cloud Deployment**: The application is deployed on **AWS Cloud**, ensuring high availability, scalability, and reliability in a production environment.
